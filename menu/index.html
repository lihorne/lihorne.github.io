My name is Liam. I'm a 22 year old software engineer and entrepreneur that loves building new things. When I was in school my friends and I started <a href="https://hackthenorth.com">Hack the North</a>, Canada's largest hackathon, to help bring the world to our hometown of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterloo,_Ontario">Waterloo</a>.

I'm the former CTO of <a href="https://piinpoint.com">PiinPoint</a>, and currently am building <a href="https://atomic.vc">Atomic</a>.
