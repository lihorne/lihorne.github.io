My name is Liam. I love building things. When I was at the University of Waterloo my friends and I started <a href="https://hackthenorth.com">Hack the North</a>, Canada's largest hackathon. I'm the former CTO of <a href="https://piinpoint.com">PiinPoint</a>, and currently am building <a href="https://atomic.vc">Atomic</a>.
